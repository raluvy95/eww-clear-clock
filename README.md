# eww-clear-clock
EWW configuration inspired by [Clear Clock KDE widget](https://github.com/qewer33/ClearClock)

To make this work perfectly, you need to install fonts required by this config.
The following fonts are:
- Outfit
- Smooch

You can get these from [here](https://github.com/qewer33/ClearClock/tree/main/package/contents/fonts)
